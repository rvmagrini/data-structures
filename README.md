## Implementation of Data Structures
- LinkedList: Singly, Doubly & Circular
- Stack
- Queue

### 1: [SINGLY LINKED LIST]
TASKS:
- [1.1] Implement LinkedList with print and length functionalities
- [1.2] Implement insertions (at the Beginning, at the End and at a given Position of the list)
- [1.3] Implement deletions (First and Last node, at a given Position of the list and node with a given Value)
- [1.4] Implement contains, get Middle node and get Nth node from the End of the list
- [1.5] Implement reverse functionality
- [1.6] Implement Sorted LinkedList with remotion of duplication functionality
